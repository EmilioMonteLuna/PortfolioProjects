# COVID-19 Data Exploration

## Overview

This project focuses on the exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data using various SQL skills, including Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. The project covers a wide range of metrics to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on different regions and populations.

## Skills Used

- **Joins:** Utilized to combine data from multiple tables, linking information from CovidDeaths, CovidVaccinations, and other datasets.

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Employed to create temporary result sets, enhancing the readability and efficiency of queries.

- **Temp Tables:** Created temporary tables to store intermediate results and facilitate complex calculations.

- **Windows Functions:** Applied window functions to perform calculations over specific partitions or ranges of data.

- **Aggregate Functions:** Used aggregate functions to compute summary statistics, such as maximum infection count and total death count.

- **Creating Views:** Created views to store reusable queries for later visualization and analysis.

- **Converting Data Types:** Ensured data consistency by converting data types when necessary.

## Project Queries

The queries cover a diverse set of analyses, including but not limited to:

- Likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in a specific country.
- Percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
- Countries with the highest infection and death rates compared to population.
- Breakdown of metrics by continent.
- Global numbers of new cases, total cases, and death percentages.
- Analysis of total population vs. vaccinations.
